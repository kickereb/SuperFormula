# SuperFormula
Trippy animations using a powerful mathematical equation in Processing Environment in Java. Adjust Parameters and input variables to create something of your own.
According to wikipedia : 

The superformula is a generalization of the superellipse and was proposed by Johan Gielis around 2000.[1] Gielis suggested that the formula can be used to describe many complex shapes and curves that are found in nature. Gielis has filed a patent application related to the synthesis of patterns generated by the superformula.

In polar coordinates, with  r the radius and á»¿ the angle, the superformula is:

By choosing different values for the parameters a, b, m, n1, n2, n3 different shapes can be generated.
