According to wikipedia : 
The superformula is a generalization of the superellipse and was proposed by Johan Gielis around 2000.[1] Gielis suggested that the formula can be used to describe many complex shapes and curves that are found in nature. Gielis has filed a patent application related to the synthesis of patterns generated by the superformula.[2]

In polar coordinates, with {\displaystyle r} r the radius and {\displaystyle \varphi } \varphi  the angle, the superformula is:

{\displaystyle r\left(\varphi \right)=\left(\left|{\frac {\cos \left({\frac {m_{1}\varphi }{4}}\right)}{a}}\right|^{n_{2}}+\left|{\frac {\sin \left({\frac {m_{2}\varphi }{4}}\right)}{b}}\right|^{n_{3}}\right)^{-{\frac {1}{n_{1}}}}.} {\displaystyle r\left(\varphi \right)=\left(\left|{\frac {\cos \left({\frac {m_{1}\varphi }{4}}\right)}{a}}\right|^{n_{2}}+\left|{\frac {\sin \left({\frac {m_{2}\varphi }{4}}\right)}{b}}\right|^{n_{3}}\right)^{-{\frac {1}{n_{1}}}}.}
By choosing different values for the parameters {\displaystyle a,b,m_{1},m_{2},n_{1},n_{2},} {\displaystyle a,b,m_{1},m_{2},n_{1},n_{2},} and {\displaystyle n_{3},} {\displaystyle n_{3},} different shapes can be generated.
